       What is [[Prototype]]: Object?
        Prototype is a base class for all the objects, and it helps us to achieve the inheritance.
        Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype.
        The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype,
        making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we 
        reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.
