        <b>Stack:-</b><br />
        The stack is a region of memory that is organized in a Last-In-First-Out
        (LIFO) manner. It is used for managing function calls and local
        variables. When a function is called, the function's parameters, return
        address, and local variables are pushed onto the stack. The top of the
        stack is always the most recently pushed item, and when a function
        execution is completed, its corresponding stack frame is popped off the
        stack. <br />
        The stack is managed by the compiler or runtime environment, and it
        provides automatic memory allocation and deallocation. Memory operations
        on the stack are fast because allocating and freeing memory is simply a
        matter of adjusting the stack pointer. However, the stack has a limited
        size, and exceeding this size can result in a stack overflow error.

      <p>
        <b>Heap:-</b><br />
        The heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. It is
        an area of memory where objects and data structures can be allocated and
        deallocated at runtime. Unlike the stack, memory allocation and
        deallocation on the heap are not handled automatically by the compiler
        or runtime environment. Instead, the programmer is responsible for
        explicitly allocating and freeing memory on the heap.<br />
        The heap provides a larger memory space compared to the stack but is
        typically slower in terms of memory operations. Memory allocation on the
        heap requires explicit calls to allocate memory (e.g., new ), and
        deallocation must also be explicitly done to free the allocated memory
        (e.g., delete). <br />
        The heap allows for dynamic memory allocation, making it suitable for
        managing large amounts of data, creating data structures dynamically, or
        allocating memory that persists beyond the scope of a function call.
        However, improper memory management on the heap can lead to memory leaks
        or fragmentation issues.
