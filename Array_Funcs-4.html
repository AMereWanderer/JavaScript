        // Another example of .reduce() function :-
        
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

        /*
         In this example, the .reduce() function is used to calculate the sum of all elements in the numbers array. 
         The callback function takes the accumulator and currentValue as parameters,
         adds them together, and returns the updated value of the accumulator.
         The initial value of the accumulator is set to 0.

         During each iteration, the accumulator is updated with the sum of the previous elements,
         and the currentValue represents the current element being processed.
         The final result is the accumulated sum of all the numbers in the array.

         We can use .reduce() to perform various operations on arrays, such as finding the maximum 
         or minimum value, concatenating strings, or generating new data structures.
